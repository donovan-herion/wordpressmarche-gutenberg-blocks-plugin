# Gutenberg from Scratch: Background Image + Front-end Style and Editor Style | Lesson 8 & 9

In these lessons we simply added the previously added backgroundImageURL to the div itself

We also added an overlay div to control opacity of the backgroundImage

This was added in the PanelBody component

The way we retrieve information from there is through the states.

///////

styles on front and back end can be totally different

Backend (EDIT styles) stores the classes into the base style-editor.scss file (in 2020 theme)

Frontend (SAVE styles) stores the classes into the sass block block.scss file (in 2020 theme)

//////

The command to compile the scss is (in 2020 theme package.json config)

```bash
npm run watch
```
